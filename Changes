Changes
=======

v0.1.5 - 18 Jun 2014
  Features:
  * Add experimental --null option
  
v0.1.4 - 17 Jun 2014
  Bugs/Fixes:
  * Check for ev.Ch and ev.Key (should fix input problems)
  * Fix crashing issue on empty match
  Features:
  * In your config, setting the value to "-" will remove the
    binding.
  * Default ToggleSelect binding has been changed to
    ToggleSelectAndSelectNext

v0.1.3 - 17 Jun 2014
  Bugs/Fixes:
  * When dealing with fast/successive user input on large buffers,
    peco was taking too long to execute queries.
  * XDG style config directories are now searched, and if all fails,
    falls back to the original ~/.peco/config.json
  * Some internal cleanup
  Features:
  * Multiple line selection has been implemented. Ctrl-Space will
    toggle the currently selected line, and peco will exit after
    printing all the selected lines. Note that on OS X, Spotlight
    by default captures these keys. You may need to reconfigure
    your settings.
  * Custom matchers via external processes have been implemented.
    See the README for more details

v0.1.2 - 16 Jun 2014
  Bugs/Fixes:
  * Multiple queries were not being match fully until the end of line
    (i.e. matches showed up correctly, but the display was not)
  * Going back to previous item from first item now pages back to last item.
  * Sending INT/TERM to peco now properly exits.
  * Some synchronization issues have been fixed (although, it would have
    never manifested itself when we were running with non-buffered channels)
  * Make sure default matcher is IgnoreCase
  Features:
  * RegExp match mode. e.g. match against "^root" or "2014-[0-9]+", etc
  * Default match mode is now configurable.
  * The entire selected line is now highlighted
  * Styles (colors and what not) can now be configured.
  * Add C-d as a default keymap for ForwardDelete
  * Add EOF handler

v0.1.1 - 12 Jun 2014
  * Fix handling malformed input (e.g. cp932 or euc-jp)
  * Make non case sensitive matching the default. C-r allows you to toggle
    between match algorithms. You can also change the default behavior
    by passing --no-ignore-case
  * Fix terminal not being updated upon executing DeleteAll
  * Fix prompt spacing
  * Add more default keymappings
  * Add peco --version

v0.1.0 - 12 Jun 2014
  * Initial versioned release
