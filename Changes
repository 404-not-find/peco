Changes
=======

v0.1.2 - 16 Jun 2014
  Bugs/Fixes:
  * Multiple queries were not being match fully until the end of line
    (i.e. matches showed up correctly, but the display was not)
  * Going back to previous item from first item now pages back to last item.
  * Sending INT/TERM to peco now properly exits.
  * Some synchronization issues have been fixed (although, it would have
    never manifested itself when we were running with non-buffered channels)
  * Make sure default matcher is IgnoreCase
  Features:
  * RegExp match mode. e.g. match against "^root" or "2014-[0-9]+", etc
  * Default match mode is now configurable.
  * The entire selected line is now highlighted
  * Styles (colors and what not) can now be configured.
  * Add C-d as a default keymap for ForwardDelete
  * Add EOF handler

v0.1.1 - 12 Jun 2014
  * Fix handling malformed input (e.g. cp932 or euc-jp)
  * Make non case sensitive matching the default. C-r allows you to toggle
    between match algorithms. You can also change the default behavior
    by passing --no-ignore-case
  * Fix terminal not being updated upon executing DeleteAll
  * Fix prompt spacing
  * Add more default keymappings
  * Add peco --version

v0.1.0 - 12 Jun 2014
  * Initial versioned release
